## Project OverView

In the MyReads project, I created a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project e using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that  used to persist information as the user interacts with the application.

## To get started developing right away:


* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
